    <h1 id="Title">Earthquakes in United States</h1>
    <p id="Desc">Earthquakes are natural phenomena that occur when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's
      crust, causing seismic waves. The United States, despite not being located on a tectonic plate boundary, still
      experiences earthquakes due to its complex geological features.</p>

    <p>The line chart shows the total number of earthquakes that occurred in the United States each year January 2013 to January 2023.</p> 
    <p>The number of earthquakes has fluctuated over the years, but there has been a general trend of increasing seismic activity.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The largest earthquake ever recorded in the United States was the 2019 Searles Valley, which had a magnitude of 7.1.</li>
      <li>Earthquakes can cause a variety of hazards, including ground shaking, landslides, liquefaction, and tsunamis.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The histogram shows the distribution of earthquake incidents in the United States by magnitude. The magnitude is
      the measure of the energy released by an earthquake, and it is expressed on a logarithmic scale. The histogram
      shows that the most common type of earthquake in the United States is a magnitude 2.5-2.9 earthquake. These
      earthquakes are usually too small to be felt by humans. However, larger earthquakes can cause significant damage
      and loss of life. The histogram also shows that the number of earthquakes decreases as the magnitude increases.
      This means that there are fewer large earthquakes than small earthquakes.</p>

    <p>The heat map shows the number of earthquake incidents in the United States from 2013 to 2023, with the darkest
      areas indicating the highest number of incidents. The heat map is based on data from the United States Geological
      Survey (USGS). The heat map shows that earthquakes are most common in the western United States, particularly in
      New Mexico, Nevada, and California. This may indicate that these states are located on or near major tectonic plate
      boundaries, which makes them more prone to earthquakes.</p>

    <p>The chart shows that earthquakes are a common occurrence in the USA, especially in certain states. While most
      earthquakes are small, larger earthquakes can cause significant damage and loss of life. The following regrions
      that are prone to earthquakes are New Mexico, Nevada, and California as they frequently experience an average of 2.8 magnitude.</p>
